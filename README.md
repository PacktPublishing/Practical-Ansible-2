This is the code repository for [Practical Ansible 2](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/practical-ansible-2?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789807462), published by Packt.

**Automate infrastructure, manage configuration, and deploy applications with Ansible 2.9**

## What is this book about?
Ansible enables you to automate software provisioning, configuration management, and application roll-outs, and can be used as a deployment and orchestration tool. While Ansible provides simple yet powerful features to automate multi-layer environments using agentless communication, it can also solve other critical IT challenges, such as ensuring continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with zero downtime.
In this book, you'll work with Ansible 2.9 and learn to solve complex issues quickly with the help of task-oriented scenarios. You'll start by installing and configuring Ansible on Linux and macOS to automate monotonous and repetitive IT tasks and get to grips with concepts such as playbooks, inventories, and network modules. As you progress, you'll gain insight into the YAML syntax and learn how to port between Ansible versions. In addition to this, you'll also understand how Ansible enables you to orchestrate multi-layer environments such as networks, containers, and the cloud.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Become familiar with the fundamentals of the Ansible framework
* Set up role-based variables and dependencies
* Avoid common mistakes and pitfalls when creating modules from scratch
* Encourage upstream contributions by submitting the plugins to Ansible
* Build best practices to create inventory files for cloud environments
